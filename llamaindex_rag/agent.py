Monitoring - evaluation - assessment - treatment


Infer diagnoses based on lab results or other symptons

Most important thing right now is to find evidence for each diagnosis,
- there has been monitoring
- or if the patient has been evaluated
- or if there is treatment
- we need to search through all the patient
- we need evidence treatement for a particular treatment
- This condition is being managed, lab results,
- what labs apply to this diagnosis,
- abnormal values must be indicated
- is condition worsening and or getting better
- give me a summary of the lab results for patient x
- have followups occured for the patient
